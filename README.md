# LearnMovementWithNeuroevolution
Using neuroevolution to teach to simple "creatures" how to move.

This project was inspired by the video [Coding Challenge #100: Neuroevolution Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw). 

Next steps:
- [ ] Try different neural network configurations (different number of hidden nodes)
- [ ] Try different settings (number, position, orientation) of the eyes.
- [ ] Think about the possibility to have a dedicated neural network only for the eyes: eyes data as input and (maybe) one output. The output is the input of the other neural network.
- [ ] What if the previous state attributes are added to the input of NN?
- [ ] Use genetic algorithms to vary the body of the robot (length, rotation speed) 
- [ ] ... include some handicap: only clockwise rotation
- [ ] visualize the neural network as graph
